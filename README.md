## About The Project
This project was created as a part of a Bachelor Thesis. It is a web application demonstrating 3 web vulnerabilities, namely SQL Injection, XSS, and Cryptographic Failures. 
The main research question guiding the devolopment of this application was <Br>
<i>How can a user-friendly web application simulate real-world web vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cryptographic Failures) and incorporate interactive features such as feedback, quizzes and logs, to enhance both hands-on-learning and conceptual understanding in Cybersecurity education?  </i>

<br> The structure of this web application is as follows:
