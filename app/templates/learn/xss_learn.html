  <h1>Cross-site scripting (XSS)</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Cross-site scripting (XSS)</strong> is a type of vulnerability found in some websites or web applications.
        It allows attackers to add harmful code (or scripts) into a web page that is viewed by other users. <br>
        This can lead to harmful outcomes such as an attacker stealing personal data and changing the content that users see on a page.
    </p>

  <h2> Understanding the Vulnerability</h2>
    <p>
        To understand this vulnerability, imagine a website asking for a comment (or any other input).
        Because the page has an XSS vulnerability, this input is used within the output page generated <i>without validation</i>.
        Instead of a comment, <i>an attacker could "trick" the website into including a malicious script when they submit the form</i> (i.e., the comment here).
        When the page is now opened by a user, the malicious script runs without their knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>
        The user’s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted and <i>will execute the script</i>.
        Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site.
        These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.

    <h2>Types of XSS Attacks</h2>
    <Strong> <i> There are three main types of XSS attacks, namely: </i></Strong>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Reflected XSS</h3>
    <p>
        This happens when the web application <i>takes input (like something you type) and includes this in the response without checking if it's safe</i>.
        <br>If an attacker sends a link that includes a harmful script, it could run on the user's browser as soon as it is clicked.
        At that point, the script can carry out any action and retrieve any data to which the user has access.
    </p> </div>

    <h3>Stored XSS</h3>
    <p>
        In this case, the harmful script is <i>saved in the website’s database</i>.
        On visiting the page where the script is saved, it automatically runs in the user's browser. It can affect all users who visit the page. <br>
        This is the most dangerous type of XSS because the attacker doesn't need to trick a user into clicking a link; they just need to add the script to the website once.
    </p>

    <h3>DOM-based XSS</h3>
    <p>
        Here, the vulnerability <i>exists in client-side code rather than server-side code</i>.
        It happens when the website uses JavaScript on the client side (such as in your browser) to show data.
        If this JavaScript processes untrusted data, it could write harmful content to the page.
        The attack happens without even needing the server to be involved.
    </p>

    <h2>Why is it dangerous?</h2>
    <p>
        As discussed above, <i>XSS make affected websites unsafe for users.</i>
        The browser trusts the malicious scripts as if they are from the website itself.
        This enables attackers to steal sensitive information, impersonate users, and change the contents of web pages, among other malicious outcomes.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Protecting from XSS</h2>
    <p>
        To prevent this problem, developers need to ensure that any input is properly checked and cleaned before being displayed on a page.
        This can be done by encoding or escaping special characters and ensuring that scripts can’t be run from user inputs.
